     * @param  null|string  $endingBefore A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
     * @param  null|string  $expand0 Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
     * @param  null|string  $expand1 Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
     * @param  null|string  $limit A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
     * @param  null|string  $startingAfter A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list.
     * @param  null|string  $status Only return VerificationSessions with this status. [Learn more about the lifecycle of sessions](https://stripe.com/docs/identity/how-sessions-work).
